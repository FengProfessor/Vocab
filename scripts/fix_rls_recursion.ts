  // Actually, I'll try to run the SQL via a migration or a direct script if I have a way.
  
  // Actually, I can just use the Service Role key in the Dashboard temporarily to see if it works, 
  // but the real fix is the DB.
  
  // Let's try to find a way to run SQL. 
  // I can use `npx supabase db execute` if I'm authenticated.
  
  // Wait, I can just write a Node script that uses the 'pg' client if I had the connection string, 
  // but I only have the Supabase keys.
  
  // I'll try to use a 'createServiceClient()' call in the dashboard itself as a "test" fix for the user first.
  // No, that's bad practice.
  
  // I'll try to run the SQL fix via `npx supabase db execute` or similar.
  // Or I can use a hack: I have the Gemini vision tool, I can't really "type" into a SQL editor easily, 
  // but I can use `run_command` with Supabase CLI.
